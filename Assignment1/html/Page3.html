                If you check “Legal Alien Not Allowed to Work” or “Other,” you must provide a document from a
                U.S. Federal, State, or local government agency that explains why you need a Social Security
                number and that you meet all the requirements for the government benefit. NOTE: Most agencies
                do not require that you have a Social Security number. Contact us to see if your reason qualifies
                for a Social Security number.

                Providing race and ethnicity information is voluntary and is requested for informational and
                statistical purposes only. Your choice whether to answer or not does not affect decisions we

                WHO CAN SIGN THE APPLICATION? If you are age 18 or older and are physically and mentally
                capable of reading and completing the application, you must sign in item 17. If you are under
                age 18, you may either sign yourself, or a parent or legal guardian may sign for you. If you are
                over age 18 and cannot sign on your own behalf, a legal guardian, parent, or close relative may
                generally sign for you. If you cannot sign your name, you should sign with an "X” mark and have
                two people sign as witnesses in the space beside the mark. Please do not alter your signature by
                including additional information on the signature line as this may invalidate your application.
                Call us if you have questions about who may sign your application.
