        <h3>Original Social Security Card</h3>
        <p>
            To apply for an priginal card, you must provide at least two documents
            to prove age, identity, and U.S. citizenship or current lawful, work-authorized
            immigration status. If you are not a U.S. citizen and do not have DHS work
            authorization, you must prove that you have a valid non-work reason for
            requesting a card. See page 2 for an explanation of acceptable documents.
        </p>

        <p>
            NOTE: If you are age 12 or older and have never received a Social Security number,
            you must apply in person.

        <h3>Replacement Social Security Card</h3>
        <p>
            To apply for a replacement card, you must provide one document to prove
            your identity. If you were born outside the U.S., you must also provide
            documents to prove your U.S. citizenship or current, lawful, work-authorization
            status. See page 2 for an explanation of acceptable documents.

        <h3>Changing Information on Your Social Security Record</h3>
        <p>
            To change the information on your social security number record (i.e., a name
            or citizenship change, or corrected date of birth) you must provide documents
            to prove your identity, support the requested change, and establish the reason
            for the change. For example, you may provide a birth certificate to show your
            correct date of birth. A document supporting a name change must be recent and
            identify you by both your old and new names. If the name change event occurred
            over two years ago or if the name change document does not have enough information
            to prove your identity, you myst also provide documents to prove your identity in
            your prior name and/or in some cases your new legal name. If you were born outside
            the U.S. you must provide a document to prove your U.S citizenship or current lawful,
            work-authorized status. See page 2 for an explanation of acceptable documents.

            <h4 class="centerh4"><u>LIMITS ON REPLACEMENT SOCIAL SECURITY CARDS</u></h4>
            <p>
                Public Law 108-458 limits the number of replacement Social Security cards you
                may receive to 3 per calendar year and 10 in a lifetime. Cards issued to reflect
                changes to your legal name or changes to a work authorization legend do not count
                toward these limits. We may also grant exceptions to these limits if you provide
                evidence from an official source to establish that a Social Security card is required.
