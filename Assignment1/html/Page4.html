        <h3 class="centerh4"><u>PROTECT YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND CARD</u></h3>
        <p>
            Protect your SSN card and number from loss and identity theft. DO NOT carry your SSN card with you.
            Keep it in a secure location and only take it with you when you must show the card; e.g., to
            obtain a new job, open a new bank account, or to obtain benefits from certain U.S. agencies.
            Use caution in giving out your Social Security number to others, particularly during phone,
            mail, email and Internet requests you did not initiate.

        <p>
            The information you furnish on this form is voluntary. However, failure to provide
            he requested information may prevent us from issuing you a Social Security number

        </p>
        <p>
            We rarely use the information you supply for any purpose other than for issuing a
            Social Security number and card. However, we may use it for the administration and
            integrity of Social Security programs. We may also disclose information to another
            person or to another agency in accordance with approved routine uses, which include

                    Security benefits and/or coverage;

        <p>
            We may also use the information you provide in computer matching programs. Matching programs
