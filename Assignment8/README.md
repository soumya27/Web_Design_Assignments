# TodoApp

It is a TODO application where user can 
1. See all todo items fetched using a REST API.
2. Click a todo item and able to see its detailed view.
3. Add a new todo item view by clicking the add button.
4. Add a todo item by entering the title, description, due date and time.
5. Mark a todo item as complete.

For this project, I used :  
1. angular HTTP client module to fetch data from the Nodejs server.
2. angular component and data binding features.
3. SCSS for CSS.
4. angular-cli for building the project
